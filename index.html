			Swift: A Solid Modern Imperative Language</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Apple recently announced the support of a new language targeted at the same application programming space as Objective C. It&rsquo;s called Swift and it seems to me a very good summary of the features all modern imperative languages are striving for.</p>

<p>The last decade or so has seen a strong resurgence in functional programing evangelism. Languages like F#, Scala, Clojure and even Erlang for a while re-introduced to mainstream programmers high-level concepts that imperative programmers were largely unfamiliar with. A short experiment with a language supporting algebraic data types, type inference, higher order functions, closures, or the standard foundational map, reduce and fold functions will convince any programmer that their language
would be far better off being more declarative.</p>

<p>For a comprehensive guide to the Swift language see the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html">Swift tour</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/upload/2014-06-04-swift-xcode6.png" title="&#34;Some Swift code in Xcode 6 beta&#34;" alt="&#34;Some Swift code in Xcode 6 beta&#34;"></p>

<p>In this article I go over what I like about this language that I see a lot of other languages striving for.</p>

<h2>Syntactic niceties</h2>

<p>Swift is a very much streamlined language, and for low friction it seems to take a lot from F#. Like F#, a programmer can seemingly almost approach swift as a scripting language &ndash; the first line in your source file can be functioning application code, no boilerplate required! And the &lsquo;playground&rsquo; concept is very familiar to anyone who has used Scala Workspaces or F# interactive mode.</p>

<p>The clarity of syntax is quite impressive &ndash; type inference introduces <code>var</code> and <code>let</code> common to many modern languages, and bracket-less control flow operations and optional semicolons make your code look a lot cleaner (and a bit like golang).</p>

<p>Structure types may be initialised in-line at the point of instantiation: <code>val vga = VideoMode(width: 800, height: 600)</code>. Once you see this you think <em>of course, why would it be otherwise?</em></p>

<p>Syntactically there is a lot of shorthand available for interacting with fundamental data types:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And anyone who loves Scala&rsquo;s string interpolation operators will appreciate the ability to write <code>println("hi, my age is \(me.age - 5)")</code>.</p>

<p>As a special treat, Swift also supports Objective-C style named parameters. This can make some functions arguments more clear when they have the same type:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>OK perhaps that is not a great example, but I think the concept has a lot of merit.</p>

<h2>Functional concepts</h2>

<p>In addition to type inference and closures, Swift has obviously been checking out the Scala and F# and the like for ideas, much to its credit.</p>

<p>First, fret not because higher-order operations are all available to you, and included in the standard library are standard set of foundational functions you&rsquo;d expect in a functional language such that it is possible to write <code>var ys = map([1,2,3], {i in i * 2})</code>.</p>

<p>But one thing that seems quite interesting to me is the extended syntax available to enumerations (known as &lsquo;associated types&rsquo;) that make them almost seem like <em>algebraic data types</em>&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;plus, if you add a new value (say, Rectangle) to the enumeration the <code>area()</code> function will fail to compile, as the compiler will complain that the switch <em>must</em> be exhaustive. Take that scala!</p>

<p>Tuples can be <em>pattern matched</em> using placeholders, bound parameters and <em>where</em> clauses, which is a fairly awesome thing:</p>

<p>There is no true currying though of course it can be simulated by having functions return other functions &ndash; garbage collection + closures means that you can create generators along the lines of:</p>

<p><em>On a side note, Scala&rsquo;s currying leaves a lot to be desired, as does it&rsquo;s support of ADTs &ndash; one must explicitly make structures a </em>case class<em> before you get functionality approaching an ADT.</em></p>

<p><em>Optional types</em> are also supported in the library but also with nice syntactic sugar. The <code>?</code> operator defines an optional type (similar to C#) and also allows operations on that type to be optionally unwound. The <code>!</code> operator forces unwinding, and causes an error if the optional type is not set.</p>

<p>Also, there is some fancy syntax for switching on an optional type:</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t even touched on a few other cool features like <code>@lazy</code> annotation, generics, variadic parameters, or the myriad ways closures can be specified (it turns out <code>{$0}</code> is a valid closure, with inferred argument and return value!)</p>

<h2>Do we need another language?</h2>

<p>Swift is certainly more approachable than Objective-C, which I very much appreciate. Apple have always been quite good at providing an environment where different languages interoperate seamlessly, so there really seems no downside &ndash; if you have a lot invested in Objective-C you can still leverage all your previous work with Swift, or presumably use other peoples swift libraries in your own Objective-C applications.</p>

<p>There will always be curmudgeons of course, but they should be ignored. The lengths that some will go to to justify not having to learn new concepts is always amazing to me, especially when doing so is the best way to progress in our industry!</p>

<p>Apple takes the development of programming languages quite seriously. They are heading up some of the more interesting additions to new versions of C++, most anticipated (by me) being the &lsquo;modules&rsquo; concept that promise to bring C++ compile times and binary interfaces in line with more modern high-level languages. They play this role of innovator well here because the concepts outlined in their proposal are drawn directly from practical experience in implementing said features in the
Objective C language itself.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick snap of the 2D SFML client alongside a new OpenGL client:

<p>OK I could have spent a bit longer on the screenshot &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t made any models yet other than cubes, and I&rsquo;m not using any textures, and I should have adjusted the angle and colour of the directional light to make it look like evening or morning or something, to show off some of the immediate benefits of going to 3D.</p>

<p>I did spend some time making the camera zoom in from a map-like view to a chase-cam view:

<p>In general however I&rsquo;m hoping to ramp-down on the OpenGL stuff and go back to working on the core functionality. The last week was actually pretty productive:

<p>Also I&rsquo;ve been spending a fair amount of time in <a href="http://picopicocafe.com">PicoPico Cafe</a> when it&rsquo;s open, and I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll be spending more time there in the coming weeks as a bunch of construction is scheduled outside my house during business hours when nobody is supposed to be home.</p>

			Week in Review: Porting to Qt/QML With OpenGL</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>So I took a month holiday, and got out of the habit of writing blogs&hellip; hopefully this will break the dam, it&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t have a billion things to write about</em></p>

<p><em>Initial version only! I will add pics soon</em></p>

<p>Over the last many weeks I have been ploughing through a whole lot of new stuff I&rsquo;ve never used before. As mentioned in my last post I decided to up the graphics a bit, but specifically I wanted to figure out a system for a extensible UI for menus and other 2D overlays, and 3D or pseudo-3D graphics. Creating a decent UI controls library I have learned is very difficult (if kind of fun to be honest.) Making something that is flexible enough to automatically layout your controls in a sensible way where everything resizes based on the
content contained within is a very difficult problem that nobody should have to re-solve in this day and age. So I wanted to re-use one that I also wanted to learn for myself.</p>

<p>In order to add these to my existing framework I took on the (it turns out) monumental task of learning OpenGL and integrating it with Qt/QtQuick/QML.</p>

<p>So far things are looking OK, but I have found the learning curve greater than I&rsquo;d originally anticipated &ndash; OpenGL in particular is a rabbit warren of deprecation and messy global state idioms. That said, I currently have:</p>

<ul>
<li>the UI menu/control system is entirely QML based and very simple to extend and use</li>
<li>the game terrain is constructed using <a href="http://www.volumesoffun.com/polyvox-about/">PolyVox</a> because I wanted to avoid having to figure out mesh generation along with all this other stuff</li>
<li>the OpenGL shaders incorporate basic lighting and not much else</li>
</ul>


<p>The main value I&rsquo;ve gained is a fairly decent understanding of what it takes to create modern OpenGL applications (though how useful that knowledge is in this day and age I am not sure.) I have not tried porting any of this across to Windows yet (I&rsquo;ve written it all in OSX) but hopefully the fact that I&rsquo;m using entirely cross-platform technologies will help a little there &ndash; though Windows is known to have very dodgy OpenGL support so I suspect that will be the cause of most of my porting
troubles.</p>

			Week in Review: Making Games</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have once again bitten off a whole lot &ndash; I started making a game based on my fairly limited knowledge of how such things are done, and have found it very difficult to take a moment to distill my thoughts. In fact it has been nearly impossible as I have been constantly unsure of whether the approach I&rsquo;m taking is actually going to pay off in the long run!</p>

<p>This is just a catch-up on my experiences over the last few weeks, a few discoveries and surprises, and perhaps my plans for the immediate future. I decided at the last moment to include a screenshot here, but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve all seen brown circles on green backgrounds before&hellip;</p>

<p>I also created a (low framerate) <a href="/images/upload/2014-02-22-game-early.gif">animated gif</a> of this in action.</p>

			Week in Review: Pausing Web App, Starting C++ App</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just over a week ago I decided to put down my web tools for a while and move to working in an environment in which I&rsquo;m much more comfortable &ndash; C++. I will definitely pick up the &lsquo;Table Top&rsquo; app (or whatever it turns into) again soon but I felt the need to do work that resulted in a more <em>tangible</em> product.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve had a growing realisation that the foundation of web programming is still immature, and I am doubting the value in investing too much time learning the high-level technologies. I am not really one for learning frameworks in general actually &ndash; I much prefer learning languages and idioms &ndash; and modern web programming is all about rapidly changing high-level frameworks.</p>

<p>That said however, I feel that I&rsquo;m finally at a point where I can start making useful stuff in Ember and Rails without feeling like I&rsquo;m misusing the tools or spending most of my time in Google. So last week I knocked off a few high-level features in my app to show the basic scaffolding I was considering (it only took a few hours in the end!), and then set it aside.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/upload/2014-02-03-seshbot-framework.png" title="&#34;Game Table App as of Feb 2014 - still doesn't do much&#34;" alt="&#34;Game Table App as of Feb 2014 - still doesn't do much&#34;"></p>

<p>There is a very duct-tape and chicken-wire feel to web technologies, but once you&rsquo;re familiar with the tech you can pump stuff out pretty quickly. Because of the immediate and ethereal nature of the web it can be a fantastic way of creating a product that is immediately globally available. All of the magic we see however is still largely magic however, and magic doesn&rsquo;t bode well in any application. The web as a platform for applications is still unbaked and young, and I feel that unless you&rsquo;re forging new territory on the frontier you&rsquo;re probably working with technologies that won&rsquo;t be interesting in a few years time.</p>

			The Best Way for Programmers to Interview Programmers</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>Every programmer should know how to give technical interviews.</strong> Although you will rarely be judged on your interviewing abilities, it is definitely in your best interest to help ensure your company is hiring effective programmers. If you manage to surround yourself with great programmers you&rsquo;ll foster a much better environment in which you can become a great programmer yourself. If you find yourself surrounded by programmers you consider sub-par you&rsquo;ll end up supporting their crappy software.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='the best way to find great programmers is by giving them some control over the interview topic, and then going deep into a few questions instead of broad across many topics'>
I have been interviewing programmers for many years and reckon the best way to find great programmers is by giving them some control over the interview topic, and then going deep into a few questions instead of broad across many topics. This takes a lot of guts however &ndash; it requires the interviewer to pay attention, and ideally (though not necessarily) to have a fairly broad knowledge base themselves.
</span></p>

<p>I believe this advice applies to all programmers &ndash; of course interviewing is rarely in your job description, but it is definitely in your best interest to make sure interviews get done well at your company. Unfortunately most companies will allow anyone to interview and won&rsquo;t have a good way to tell that they&rsquo;re not doing it well, ultimately damaging the work environment.</p>

			Client-side Authentication With Ember and Rails</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This post follows on from the previous post <a href="/blog/2014/01/15/creating-a-rails-plus-ember-app-from-scratch/">creating and deploying a rails + ember app from scratch</a>. In that post I created a basic ember application being served from rails. Here I&rsquo;ll be adding user authentication to the application I created using the &lsquo;edge template&rsquo; option I discussed, which uses the &lsquo;ember-rails&rsquo; gem to establish the basic connectivity.</em></p>

<p>I do not want to implement authentication and authorization myself. It is tricky to get right and tends to cause huge damage when it goes wrong in production.</p>

<p>So I have spent at least three full days looking at various solutions I can build into my simple Ember/Rails application and spent a lot of time experimenting.</p>

<p>This post describes my current understanding of authentication for web applications, and the approach I used to implement a basic authentication system I put up on heroku at <a href="http://seshbot.herokuapp.com">http://seshbot.herokuapp.com</a></p>

<p><em>NOTE: this is very text-heavy because after three full days I decided not to spend too long on this blog post. Therefore there are no images at this time. I may update it later to have some nice UML or screenshots, but that time is not now.</em></p>

			Creating and Deploying a Rails + Ember App</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today I decided to wield my new Rails and Ember knowledge and&hellip; look into yet another new technology. I thought it would be helpful to have an online app to demonstrate the fruits of my labours, so am deploying a new app to <strong><a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Heroku is an &lsquo;application platform&rsquo; in the cloud, meaning that you can push certain kinds of apps (written in Ruby, Python, Java and Node.js) and it will ensure all the correct infrastructure is in place. When you sign up you get to host one app for free so it&rsquo;s easy to try out.</p>

<p>Later I will probably move to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>, which provides a basic virtual machine in the cloud that you can do anything with. This will allow me to host multiple applications without having to worry about paying money. Heroku <em>does</em> offer some pretty nice scaling, monitoring and deployment tools though (the admin panel literally has a slider to allow you to spin up new application instances.)</p>

<p>This post shows how I went through all steps, including setting up the PostgreSQL database on OSX, creating a skeleton Rails app, and deploying to Heroku. It is a culmination of having gone through several sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>much was taken from this useful step-by-step &lsquo;<a href="http://www.devmynd.com/blog/2013-3-rails-ember-js">Rails + Ember blog post</a>&rsquo; and this <a href="http://www.devmynd.com/blog/2013-10-live-on-the-edge-with-rails-ember-js">follow up post</a> that incorporates changes for newer versions of the frameworks.</li>
<li>when I got to the part involving installing the &lsquo;ember-rails&rsquo; gem, I found that the <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails">ember-rails documentation</a> was pretty useful.</li>
<li>some of the Heroku stuff came from the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/code_tv/heroku">Heroku Code School lesson</a> summary.</li>
</ul>

			Learning Ruby and Rails</a>

		<p><em>Note: The formatting of this article is not great, but I pumped it out quickly after going through the tutorials</em></p>

<p>I dedicated this morning to learning some Ruby and Ruby on Rails (RoR). For my purposes, RoR provides the server-side API to a web application, like this:</p>

<center><img src='/images/plantuml/dc42b2dad537dd0af4f1a7d3eed736ba.png'></center>


<p>To my delight, I quickly discovered that Ember (which I have been messing around with quite a bit) is modelled directly on Rails &ndash; not just in the generic they-are-both-MVC-architectures-way, but down to their usages being identical in many respects. I think many new webby techs follow this same style (Meteor seems to, for example.)</p>

<p>This post outlines the core concepts I have picked up from the various tutorials. I also included a RoR cheat-sheet I created while doing the Rails tutorial.</p>

<p>To get started on Windows/Mac, I&rsquo;m guessing the easiest way is by downloading the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org">RailsInstaller</a>.</p>

			This Week in Review: My Game Table Web App</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>First here&rsquo;s a quick summary of what I got up to:</p>

<ol>
<li>trying to build a simple &lsquo;gaming table&rsquo; application in Ember.js,</li>
<li>styling with Twitter bootstrap,</li>
<li>messing with plugins in my blog (trying unsuccessfully to fix code highlighting, and adding a UML tool &ndash; see below)</li>
</ol>


<center><img src='/images/plantuml/7f148dfb8d968e365103d42622a30b55.png'></center>


<p>I spent most of my time learning about Ember. <a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember.js</a> is a very nice looking front-end MVC framework that has a very appealing <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/">getting started guide</a> that make it look <em>super simple</em> to create a reactive application. Three things that people will not tell you however:</p>

<ul>
<li>demo videos only ever show the main usage scenario of that framework</li>
<li>most new frameworks change so often that they&rsquo;re either unstable or very little up-to-date documentation exists, and</li>
<li>many of the benefits they offer you probably won&rsquo;t end up using anyway, for various reasons</li>
</ul>


<p>For now though I&rsquo;ll go ahead with it because I feel that I&rsquo;m just about to start doing cool stuff in it (it kinda always feels like this though.)</p>

<p><strong>Next week</strong> I&rsquo;m thinking of switching back to some C++ stuff so I can dabble in a realm I&rsquo;m more comfortable with for a while&hellip; Monday is a public holiday in Japan though so I&rsquo;ll probably be wandering around and not programming much.</p>
