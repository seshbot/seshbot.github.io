<p>I intend to spend the next six to twelve months attempting to see what happens when I have time to myself.</p>

<h3>So far&hellip;.</h3>

<p>This is only the first week of my grand experiment. So far I have spent most of it gaming with my other unemployed friends (Pathfinder card game is awesome.) I did set up this blog however, and register seshbot.com, so I suppose it&rsquo;s not a complete loss work-wise.</p>

<h3>Blogging</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited about following an open development process. Source code is only a part of an application however, the analysis and design are integral pieces that I would like to make visible. I am concerned that setting up this blog before I have anything to show is setting the cart before the horse, but it seemed like the smallest most approachable project I could scope out for the first week.</p>

<p>The Octopress platform seems very developer-friendly. I can trivially embed syntax highlighted source code snippets and extend the framework through a simple plugin mechanism (I think.) There is no fancy web UI for composing posts &ndash; its all authoring markup on your local machine then pushing the generated code to github and letting github pages take care of the rest. Writing a new blog post is a matter of:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>&gt; rake new_post[&#39;My New Post!&#39;]
Creating new post: source/_posts/2013-12-20-my-new-post.markdown
&gt; vim source/_posts/2013-12-20-my-new-post.markup
&gt; rake generate
Successfully generated site: source -&gt; public
&gt; rake deploy</code></pre>
</div>


<p>There&rsquo;s of course so much more you can do (preview it locally before uploading for example) but that&rsquo;s the basic workflow.</p>

<h3>Project</h3>

<p>I have a bunch of stuff I want to mess with, but I intend to start writing a few simple web applications. I have in mind some kind of Ruby-on-Rails stack using <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> for the browser&rsquo;s UI modeling. A shared drawing application perhaps?</p>

<p>Also, I would love to mess around more with C++11/C++14, I have played a little so far and have been very impressed with the productivity and conciseness it affords (it&rsquo;s about time!) A little network game perhaps? I really would love to make a little modular adventure game at some stage. Who knows, perhaps I will be the one to finally make a nice graphical <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a> clone? That seems to be the indy gaming unicorn.</p>

<h3>Japan Lifestyle</h3>

<p>So far I have had mixed success. Living in Japan without a job is a little challenging, though I suspect that would be true in most countries. The immediate challenges are keeping my house (I must renew my lease and they weren&rsquo;t too impressed with the blank &lsquo;employment&rsquo; section of the document) and preparing to pay the various taxes &ndash; most notably residential tax and health insurance, both of which are means-based on the previous years income.</p>

<p>I was very happy to discover that just around the corner from my house is a little cafe run by a very friendly independent game-developer &ndash; <a href="http://picopicocafe.com">PicoPico cafe</a>. Once a month they hold &lsquo;PicoTachi&rsquo;, an event for independent developers (and anyone else really) to show off stuff they&rsquo;ve been working on. That seems almost too fortuitous! I am also looking forward to working in the cafe by myself, it has a very nice ambiance.</p>
