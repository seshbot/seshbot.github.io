	<h2 class="title">Week in Review: Pausing Web App, Starting C++ App</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Just over a week ago I decided to put down my web tools for a while and move to working in an environment in which I&rsquo;m much more comfortable &ndash; C++. I will definitely pick up the &lsquo;Table Top&rsquo; app (or whatever it turns into) again soon but I felt the need to do work that resulted in a more <em>tangible</em> product.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve had a growing realisation that the foundation of web programming is still immature, and I am doubting the value in investing too much time learning the high-level technologies. I am not really one for learning frameworks in general actually &ndash; I much prefer learning languages and idioms &ndash; and modern web programming is all about rapidly changing high-level frameworks.</p>

<p>That said however, I feel that I&rsquo;m finally at a point where I can start making useful stuff in Ember and Rails without feeling like I&rsquo;m misusing the tools or spending most of my time in Google. So last week I knocked off a few high-level features in my app to show the basic scaffolding I was considering (it only took a few hours in the end!), and then set it aside.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/upload/2014-02-03-seshbot-framework.png" title="&#34;Game Table App as of Feb 2013 - still doesn't do much&#34;" alt="&#34;Game Table App as of Feb 2013 - still doesn't do much&#34;"></p>

<p>There is a very duct-tape and chicken-wire feel to web technologies, but once you&rsquo;re familiar with the tech you can pump stuff out pretty quickly. Because of the immediate and ethereal nature of the web it can be a fantastic way of creating a product that is immediately globally available. All of the magic we see however is still largely built with duct tape and chewing gum. The web as a platform for applications is still unbaked and young, and I feel that unless you&rsquo;re forging new territory on the frontier you&rsquo;re probably working with technologies that won&rsquo;t be interesting in a few years time.</p>

<h2>The Web as a Software Platform</h2>

<p>HTTP, HTML, JavaScript and CSS have been around for a while now, so why have all the useful standards for building proper web applications (like WebGL, WebSockets, local storage, drag-and-drop and all those other HTML5 goodies) only started coming along recently?</p>

<p>It turns out that for a long time web standards were committee-driven by a group called W3C. I still recall fairly recent times when the latest advances in the web were all about creating HTML that was also standards-conforming XML for some reason (so that perhaps machines could deal with it more easily or something?) and very little practical advancement was being made.</p>

<p>At some stage however another working group arose called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG">WHATWG</a>, formed of people that were actually interested in pushing practical new technologies onto the web, and they pretty much ignored the W3C&rsquo;s direction.</p>

<p>The WHATWG formed in 2004 in response to the stagnating web standards, and in 2007 the W3C finally got on board and standardised HTML5 based on a whole bunch of the WHATWG&rsquo;s tools. They pretty much totally abandoned their whole XHTML thing, which I don&rsquo;t think anyone really regrets.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there have been bursts of innovation on the web, but without a fully baked platform on which to create them. So all these high-level frameworks have temporarily filled the gaps while the HTML spec catches up. In fact, Google&rsquo;s Angular framework (an alternative to Ember.js) has the explicit goal of becoming obsolete when Google manages to get their tools into the standard &ndash; it&rsquo;s a kind of proof-of-concept of Google&rsquo;s vision for client-side application development.</p>

<p>I chose Ember because if you&rsquo;re going with a framework, you might as well go with one that provides abstractions that make sense to you. But I don&rsquo;t have high hopes for it&rsquo;s long-term availability as the web matures, and so feel that there is limited long-term value in becoming some kind of Ember guru.</p>

<h2>My Web App</h2>

<p>The current proof of concept is at <a href="http://seshbot.herokuapp.com.">http://seshbot.herokuapp.com.</a> It still doesn&rsquo;t have the meat in it but it has the authentication, some mobile-friendliness, and sorta models the notions of &lsquo;games&rsquo; and &lsquo;players&rsquo; in games.</p>

<p>I was much surprised to find out that there is not much of a story yet for how to provide a real-time connection between the backend and the Ember application, where updates on the server are actively pushed out to the client. This is probably the next big thing I&rsquo;ll have to do &ndash; create an adapter that connects to the server (probably using server-side events and one of the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/streaming-with-rails-4/">Rails4 streaming APIs</a>) and injects incoming updates into the model using the Ember Data API, similar to the <a href="https://github.com/thomasboyt/ember-firebase-adapter">EmberFire Firebase library</a>.</p>

<p>Other than that, the two remaining things I can think of are: making it look like a gaming application (nice rose-wood tabletop look or something?) and adding a few components that I want to have in there like a chat client, a dice area and some kind of card game. This is the nice bit where I get to play around with things, I&rsquo;m looking forward to experimenting with the interactivity side of things, perhaps dragging cards around or having some sound built into it.</p>

<p>I have put this aside however because I don&rsquo;t want to burn out on it. I think it&rsquo;s time to take a break so that I can come back with a fresh set of eyes &ndash; perhaps I&rsquo;ll decide it&rsquo;s not worth continuing at all in lieu of some other app.</p>

<h2>New C++ App</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to mess around with C++11 for a long time now, and have made a lot of little sample applications that allow me to get a feel for it. I really want to try creating a real application that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>cross platform</li>
<li>uses built-in C++11 stuff like chrono, threads, lambdas, auto etc</li>
<li>provides a few services I&rsquo;ve come to enjoy in newer languages such as dependency containers (if feasible!)</li>
<li>allows me to experiment with GL shaders, which I&rsquo;ve wanted to play with for <em>years</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>So I spent a few days writing a basic app in <a href="https://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:Tools::QtCreator">QT Creator</a> using <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> as the build system. There were a few hurdles but it didn&rsquo;t take long to get up and running. Because I&rsquo;m limiting myself to core C++, boost and a couple of cross-platform libraries (<a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a> for graphics and <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen</a> for linear algebra stuff) it&rsquo;s still pretty versatile. And because I&rsquo;m using CMake I&rsquo;ll be able to use Visual Studio to develop in Windows and QT Creator or XCode or whatever I want in OSX. I&rsquo;ll try to stick with QT Creator where possible though for consistency.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/upload/2014-02-03-qtcreator.png" title="&#34;QT Creator actually looks pretty nice&#34;" alt="&#34;QT Creator actually looks pretty nice&#34;"></p>

<p>I am a bit worried about Windows compatability &ndash; Visual C++ has always lagged behind in standards conformance, but they have picked up their pace somewhat in the recent future. I am avoiding some of the more esoteric stuff however, such as variadic templates, because of VC++.</p>

<p>I would also really like to try messing around with QML &ndash; Qt&rsquo;s DSL for writing GUI applications. It reminds me of WPF only in a much cleaner, less hacky way, with JavaScript capabilities built straight into it. Ideally I will figure out a way to use Qt Quick/QML seamlessly with the OpenGL stuff provided by SFML, though I am less optimistic about that. Previous experience tells me that you don&rsquo;t want to be re-creating GUI widget libraries because layout management is a complete bitch, but I think QML is still a bit young to work in arbitrary circumstances.</p>

<h2>Blogging</h2>

<p>I found it very difficult to blog about my experiences with Ember and Rails. There is a lot of stuff out there covering the same stuff I would cover, only terribly out of date. This made me feel that my posts too would just become so much flotsam on a sea of irrelevant minutiae.</p>

<p>The main value I was really getting though was as a reference for myself so I could close some of my browser tabs without worrying that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to find that one piece of information again, and also so that I could distill my thoughts on something before putting it aside.</p>

<p>I have about 3 unpublished posts on my experience over the last few weeks &ndash; I&rsquo;ll probably put them together under one post about Ember development, but not for a little while now I&rsquo;m guessing.</p>

<p>I am much more certain of my opinion on C++ related matters, so I imagine that there will be a few long rants in that general direction coming up.</p>
