    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just over a week ago I decided to put down my web tools for a while and move to working in an environment in which I&rsquo;m much more comfortable &ndash; C++. I will definitely pick up the &lsquo;Table Top&rsquo; app (or whatever it turns into) again soon but I felt the need to do work that resulted in a more <em>tangible</em> product.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve had a growing realisation that the foundation of web programming is still immature, and I am doubting the value in investing too much time learning the high-level technologies. I am not really one for learning frameworks in general actually &ndash; I much prefer learning languages and idioms &ndash; and modern web programming is all about rapidly changing high-level frameworks.</p>

<p>That said however, I feel that I&rsquo;m finally at a point where I can start making useful stuff in Ember and Rails without feeling like I&rsquo;m misusing the tools or spending most of my time in Google. So last week I knocked off a few high-level features in my app to show the basic scaffolding I was considering (it only took a few hours in the end!), and then set it aside.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/upload/2014-02-03-seshbot-framework.png" title="&ldquo;Game Table App as of Feb 2014 &ndash; still doesn&rsquo;t do much&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>There is a very duct-tape and chicken-wire feel to web technologies, but once you&rsquo;re familiar with the tech you can pump stuff out pretty quickly. Because of the immediate and ethereal nature of the web it can be a fantastic way of creating a product that is immediately globally available. All of the magic we see however is still largely magic however, and magic doesn&rsquo;t bode well in any application. The web as a platform for applications is still unbaked and young, and I feel that unless you&rsquo;re forging new territory on the frontier you&rsquo;re probably working with technologies that won&rsquo;t be interesting in a few years time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The Web as a Software Platform</h2>

<p>HTTP, HTML, JavaScript and CSS have been around for a while now, so why have all the useful standards for building proper web applications (like WebGL, WebSockets, local storage, drag-and-drop and all those other HTML5 goodies) only started coming along recently?</p>

<p>It turns out that for a long time web standards were committee-driven by a group of beard-stroking high-falutin non-visionaries called W3C. I still recall fairly recent times when the latest advances in the web were all about creating HTML that was also standards-conforming XML for some reason (so that perhaps machines could deal with it more easily or something?) and very little practical advancement was being made. (Side note: the same thing seems to be happening with OAuth, which is a morass of unproven ideas and conflicting ideals.)</p>

<p>At some stage however another working group arose called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG">WHATWG</a>, formed of people that were actually interested in pushing practical new technologies onto the web, and they pretty much ignored the W3C&rsquo;s direction.</p>

<p>The WHATWG formed in 2004 in response to the stagnating web standards, and in 2007 the W3C finally got on board and standardised HTML5 based on a whole bunch of the WHATWG&rsquo;s tools. They pretty much totally abandoned their whole XHTML thing, which I don&rsquo;t think anyone really regrets.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there have been bursts of innovation on the web, but without a fully baked platform on which to create them. So all these high-level frameworks have temporarily filled the gaps while the HTML spec catches up. In fact, Google&rsquo;s Angular framework (an alternative to Ember.js) has the explicit goal of becoming obsolete when Google manages to get their tools into the standard &ndash; it&rsquo;s a kind of proof-of-concept of Google&rsquo;s vision for client-side application development.</p>

<p>I chose Ember because if you&rsquo;re going with a framework, you might as well go with one that provides abstractions that make sense to you. But I don&rsquo;t have high hopes for it&rsquo;s long-term availability as the web matures, and so feel that there is limited long-term value in becoming some kind of Ember guru.</p>

<h2>My Web App</h2>

<p>The current proof of concept is at <a href="http://seshbot.herokuapp.com.">http://seshbot.herokuapp.com.</a> It still doesn&rsquo;t have the meat in it but it has the authentication, some mobile-friendliness, and sorta models the notions of &lsquo;games&rsquo; and &lsquo;players&rsquo; in games.</p>

<p>I was much surprised to find out that there is not much of a story yet for how to provide a real-time connection between the backend and the Ember application, where updates on the server are actively pushed out to the client. This is probably the next big thing I&rsquo;ll have to do &ndash; create an adapter that connects to the server (probably using server-side events and one of the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/streaming-with-rails-4/">Rails4 streaming APIs</a>) and injects incoming updates into the model using the Ember Data API, similar to the <a href="https://github.com/thomasboyt/ember-firebase-adapter">EmberFire Firebase library</a>.</p>

<p>Other than that, the two remaining things I can think of are: making it look like a gaming application (nice rose-wood tabletop look or something?) and adding a few components that I want to have in there like a chat client, a dice area and some kind of card game. This is the nice bit where I get to play around with things, I&rsquo;m looking forward to experimenting with the interactivity side of things, perhaps dragging cards around or having some sound built into it.</p>

<p>I have put this aside however because I don&rsquo;t want to burn out on it. I think it&rsquo;s time to take a break so that I can come back with a fresh set of eyes &ndash; perhaps I&rsquo;ll decide it&rsquo;s not worth continuing at all in lieu of some other app.</p>

<h2>New C++ App</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to mess around with C++11 for a long time now, and have made a lot of little sample applications that allow me to get a feel for it. I really want to try creating a real application that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>cross platform</li>
<li>uses built-in C++11 stuff like chrono, threads, lambdas, auto etc</li>
<li>provides a few services I&rsquo;ve come to enjoy in newer languages such as dependency containers (if feasible!)</li>
<li>allows me to experiment with GL shaders, which I&rsquo;ve wanted to play with for <em>years</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p>So I spent a few days writing a basic app in <a href="https://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:Tools::QtCreator">QT Creator</a> using <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> as the build system. There were a few hurdles but it didn&rsquo;t take long to get up and running. Because I&rsquo;m limiting myself to core C++, boost and a couple of cross-platform libraries (<a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a> for graphics and <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen</a> for linear algebra stuff) it&rsquo;s still pretty versatile. And because I&rsquo;m using CMake I&rsquo;ll be able to use Visual Studio to develop in Windows and QT Creator or XCode or whatever I want in OSX. I&rsquo;ll try to stick with QT Creator where possible though for consistency.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/upload/2014-02-03-qtcreator.png" title="&ldquo;QT Creator actually looks pretty nice&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>I am a bit worried about Windows compatability &ndash; Visual C++ has always lagged behind in standards conformance, but they have picked up their pace somewhat in the recent future. I am avoiding some of the more esoteric stuff however, such as variadic templates, because of VC++.</p>

<p>I would also really like to try messing around with QML &ndash; Qt&rsquo;s DSL for writing GUI applications. It reminds me of WPF only in a much cleaner, less hacky way, with JavaScript capabilities built straight into it. Ideally I will figure out a way to use Qt Quick/QML seamlessly with the OpenGL stuff provided by SFML, though I am less optimistic about that. Previous experience tells me that you don&rsquo;t want to be re-creating GUI widget libraries because layout management is a complete bitch, but I think QML is still a bit young to work in arbitrary circumstances.</p>

<h2>Blogging</h2>

<p>I found it very difficult to blog about my experiences with Ember and Rails. There is a lot of stuff out there covering the same stuff I would cover, only terribly out of date. This made me feel that my posts too would just become so much flotsam on a sea of irrelevant minutiae.</p>

<p>The main value I was really getting though was as a reference for myself so I could close some of my browser tabs without worrying that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to find that one piece of information again, and also so that I could distill my thoughts on something before putting it aside.</p>

<p>I have about 3 unpublished posts on my experience over the last few weeks &ndash; I&rsquo;ll probably put them together under one post about Ember development, but not for a little while now I&rsquo;m guessing.</p>

<p>I am much more certain of my opinion on C++ related matters, so I imagine that there will be a few long rants in that general direction coming up.</p>

    <link href="http://seshbot.com/blog/2014/01/22/client-side-authentication-with-ember-and-rails/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-22T00:30:27+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://seshbot.com/blog/2014/01/22/client-side-authentication-with-ember-and-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post follows on from the previous post <a href="/blog/2014/01/15/creating-a-rails-plus-ember-app-from-scratch/">creating and deploying a rails + ember app from scratch</a>. In that post I created a basic ember application being served from rails. Here I&rsquo;ll be adding user authentication to the application I created using the &lsquo;edge template&rsquo; option I discussed, which uses the &lsquo;ember-rails&rsquo; gem to establish the basic connectivity.</em></p>

<p>I do not want to implement authentication and authorization myself. It is tricky to get right and tends to cause huge damage when it goes wrong in production.</p>

<p>So I have spent at least three full days looking at various solutions I can build into my simple Ember/Rails application and spent a lot of time experimenting.</p>

<p>This post describes my current understanding of authentication for web applications, and the approach I used to implement a basic authentication system I put up on heroku at <a href="http://seshbot.herokuapp.com">http://seshbot.herokuapp.com</a></p>

<p>If you want to see the source code, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/seshbot/new-ember-rails-app">https://github.com/seshbot/new-ember-rails-app</a></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/upload/2014-01-22-seshbot-login.png" title="&ldquo;Oh jeez I already forgot my password&rdquo;" ></p>

<p><em>NOTE: this is very text-heavy because after three full days I decided not to spend too long on this blog post. Therefore there are no images at this time. I may update it later to have some nice UML or screenshots, but that time is not now.</em></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Learning the basic concepts</h2>

<p>I found a few very detailed introductions to client-side authentication with ember which helped me through all stages of implementation of my system. I highly recommending going through the following resources and comparing the different approaches' overlaps and differences. I also got a lot of value out of re-visiting them after I finished implementing my own solution, because it made me think about some of the trade offs I had made.</p>

<h3>Watch these awesome client-side suthentication videos</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.embercasts.com/">http://www.embercasts.com/</a> covers the client-side concepts of authentication with Ember in <a href="http://www.embercasts.com/episodes/client-side-authentication-part-1">part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.embercasts.com/episodes/client-side-authentication-part-2">part 2</a> of their &lsquo;Client Side Authentication&rsquo; videos. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>client token authentication concepts</li>
<li>sending auth request to the server and saving the token (in a &lsquo;login&rsquo; controller)</li>
<li>setting up controllers</li>
<li>catching &lsquo;unauthorised&rsquo; error responses and redirecting to login pages</li>
<li>keeping a sane workflow so the login transitions the user back to their original page</li>
<li>storing the auth token in local storage so page refresh doesn&rsquo;t reset it <em>(note: I used cookies instead of local storage)</em></li>
<li>preventing the unauthorized server request if client knows it doesn&rsquo;t yet have a token</li>
</ul>


<p>This doesn&rsquo;t cover the server side, or anything to do with Rails or any other authenticating server specifically &ndash; he used a home-grown demonstration Node.js server for the demonstration. Also doesn&rsquo;t specifically cover authorization (I can see users but can&rsquo;t see their emails for example.) The ember front-end polish in there is all nice though, and I found it very helpful to revisit these videos after I had a basic system in place, in order to add nice error messages and improving the &lsquo;view page/redirect to login/return to page&rsquo; workflow.</p>

<h3>Read about SimpLabs' experience making Ember.SimpleAuth</h3>

<p>SimpLabs wrote a <a href="http://log.simplabs.com/post/57702291669/better-authentication-in-ember-js">blog post</a> detailing their experiences getting ember authentication to work sensibly and according to the various standards.</p>

<p>They wrapped this functionality up in an ember plugin called <a href="https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth">Ember.SimpleAuth</a> (and wrote about <a href="http://log.simplabs.com/post/63565686488/ember-simpleauth">how to use it</a>). There&rsquo;s even a <a href="https://github.com/ugisozols/ember-simple-auth-rails-demo">demo rails app</a> that uses it.</p>

<h3>Follow the very detailed ember-auth + devise tutorial</h3>

<p>Someone else has written a rails plugin called <a href="https://github.com/heartsentwined/ember-auth-rails">ember-auth</a> that presumably takes care of both sides (rails server and ember client) of the problem. The true value for learning is in the <a href="https://github.com/heartsentwined/ember-auth-rails-demo/wiki">demo application&rsquo;s tutorial</a> however, which covers:</p>

<ul>
<li>setting up your rails app</li>
<li>setting up devise for rails</li>
<li>modeling the server entities and API endpoints</li>
<li>writing tests for all of the above</li>
<li>setting up your ember app</li>
<li>creating front-end UIs for authentication with ember</li>
</ul>


<p>It also has a separate page that goes into <a href="https://github.com/heartsentwined/ember-auth/wiki/Security">security concerns</a> that highlights a few best practices to keep in mind that frameworks will probably not implement for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>always use https</li>
<li>authentication checks in the client are a convenience only and should never replace auth validation in the server</li>
<li>do not use the &lsquo;current user&rsquo; ID when retrieving priveleged resources (i.e., don&rsquo;t use client-provided data when performing authorization related functionality)</li>
<li>never store any credential information in cookies &ndash; generally just store the server token, which is expendable</li>
<li>do not rely on the client framework alone to clear caches etc when logging out &ndash; ember data for example doesn&rsquo;t offer a way to clear the data store</li>
</ul>


<h3>A few other side-notes while we&rsquo;re talking theoretical</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kristianmandrup/ember-beercan">ember-beercan</a> seems to explore a different approach that I don&rsquo;t really like, but does have some interesting information on using rails and devise on the server side that I might look at later.</p>

<p>A general concern to keep in mind is that for security reasons if the client-side application is not running on the same url/port as the server application the browser might refuse to let them communicate. In this case apparently you should add Rack::Cors to your app (haven&rsquo;t looked into that yet.)</p>

<p>There is also a lot of discussion around whether the client side should be involved at all in the auth negotiation, and perhaps leaving that up to a separate set of pages served by the server, and the server refuse access to the app at all until that time. This makes the client app much simpler as it can always assume that the user is authenticated (see stack overflow questions <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19401087/ember-js-how-to-get-access-to-store-from-app-object">how to access store from app object</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19414393/ember-js-session-cookie-based-authentication-with-rails-and-devise">session cookie based auth with rails and devise</a>.)</p>

<p>When looking into server-side authentication information I found <a href="http://www.robertsosinski.com/2008/02/23/simple-and-restful-authentication-for-ruby-on-rails/">this description of a simple hand-rolled solution</a> to be quite helpful, because it is quite short and covers only the rails side.</p>

<h2>What we want from an auth system</h2>

<p>A minimal authentication system should provide:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>create user</em>: an interface for creating users</li>
<li><em>login user</em>: an interface for authenticating a user based on username or email address and password</li>
<li>error handling: the interface should provide nice handling for errors (if there&rsquo;s an error message it should be printed nicely)</li>
<li>allow session to persist for some amount of time so the user doesn&rsquo;t have to log in every time they come back</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition however, we want the system to provide authrisation:</p>

<ul>
<li>separation of user roles (administrators, regular users, guests/unauthenticated users)</li>
<li>authorisation of access to server resources &ndash; the server should send a <em>401 unauthorized</em> response to unauthorised requests</li>
<li>sensible UI workflow for logging in and unauthorised access attempts

<ul>
<li>when a server responds with a 401 response, the UI should take the user to the login screen</li>
<li>after login, the user should be returned to a sensible page, possibly based on what they were trying to achieve before being redirected to the login page</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course the system has to follow industry practices and where possible use well-established technologies to offload all the dangerous stuff like dealing with passwords and hashing.</p>

<h2>Building an Authenticating app</h2>

<p>I spent a <em>lot</em> of time experimenting with the various options, generally with little success. The executive summary is that most high-level plugins are generally not production ready, or don&rsquo;t work well together with the latest versions of other parts of the architecture. I ended up following a great tutorial on how to hand-roll your own authentication framework in Ember and Rails, using only a single bcrypt Rails gem for the password stuff.</p>

<h3>Failed attempt 1: ember-auth-easy Rails gem</h3>

<p>I was quite hopeful when I found <a href="https://github.com/mharris717/ember-auth-easy">ember-auth-easy</a> which was made to work with <a href="https://github.com/mharris717/ember_auth_rails">ember-auth-rails</a> to provide a full Rails backend/Ember frontend token based authentication solution.</p>

<p>Unfortunately as with so many things in Rails these days, lots of stuff doesn&rsquo;t work with lots of other stuff if you&rsquo;re trying to use the latest versions of things. The devise rails integration was found to be lacking for some reason and there was some mass change involved that broke backwards compatability, and many slightly older gems don&rsquo;t seem to work well anymore. I think it was made to work with Rails 3 as well (I&rsquo;m on Rails 4.)</p>

<p>In addition, there&rsquo;s a whole lot of gems up there and I&rsquo;m starting to get pissed off at having to learn 5 new buzzword-riddled technologies for every one new one I learn.</p>

<p>Before I decided to abandon it I created the following steps (I write it here in case I decide to go back to it later)</p>

<p>```bash Rails Trying to install ember-auth-rails on Rails
vim Gemfile</p>

<h1>add the following: # gem &lsquo;ember_auth_rails&rsquo;, :git => git://github.com/seshbot/ember_auth_rails.git</h1>

<h1>gem &lsquo;ember-data-source&rsquo;, &lsquo;>= 1.0.0.beta.3&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lt; 2.0&rsquo; # ember-data not yet out of beta</h1>

<h1>gem &lsquo;emblem-rails&rsquo;, &lsquo;~> 0.1&rsquo; # easier to write templates</h1>

<h1>gem &lsquo;ember-auth-session-cookie-rails&rsquo;, &lsquo;~> 1.0&rsquo; # use cookies</h1>

<h1>gem &lsquo;ember-auth-module-ember_data-rails&rsquo;, &lsquo;~> 1.0&rsquo; # ember-data integration</h1>

<p>#</p>

<h1>gem &lsquo;devise&rsquo;</h1>

<p>vim config/application.rb</p>

<h1>add &ldquo;require &lsquo;devise&rsquo;&rdquo; to bottom</h1>

<p>bundle install # install new gems
bundle exec rake ember_auth_rails_engine:install:migrations
rails g devise:install
bundle exec rake db:migrate</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>So I hand-rolled my solution</h3>

<p>I eventually found a great post called <a href="http://coderberry.me/blog/2013/07/08/authentication-with-emberjs-part-1/">authentication with ember.js</a> by a dude who seems to really know what he&rsquo;s talking about. It seems to be a culmination of several weeks of work, and a collaboration with a few other developers. It also includes a link to <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api">Rails::API</a>, which I really want to use in the future.</p>

<p>The Rails server in the tutorial provides an API that allows creation of a new user, authenticates a user/password combination, and provides admin information to authenticated users. The rails implementation code consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>router exposes a <em>user</em> resource (for creation and reading) and a <em>session creation</em> post route</li>
<li><code>user</code> model is composed of multiple <code>api-key</code>s &ndash; when the model is loaded, it will create a new api-key if there are no remaining active session keys

<ul>
<li>the <code>user</code> model also invokes the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/SecurePassword/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_secure_password">has_secure_password</a> security method that provides an <em>authenticate</em> method (this is built into the Rails framework and uses the bcrypt gem)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>api-key</code> model is composed of an <em>access token</em> and an <em>exipiry time</em></li>
<li>all controllers have access to an <em>ensure_authenticated_user</em> function that searches for an active API session key that is associated with the current <em>HTTP_AUTHORIZATION</em> HTTP header</li>
<li>the <code>user</code> controller allows an unauthenticated client to show or create a new user record, but requires an authenticated session to show all users</li>
<li>the <code>session</code> controller (invoked via HTTP <em>post</em> from the <em>session creation</em> route) provides <em>login</em> functionality (session creation)

<ul>
<li>first it looks up a <code>user</code> associated with the given username or email</li>
<li>it then invokes the user object&rsquo;s <em>authenticate</em> method with the given password</li>
<li>if either of these steps fail a HTTP 401 response is returned, otherwise a 201 response with the user&rsquo;s <em>session API key</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>In the implementation provided in this system, the notion of a <em>session</em> is not actually stored anywhere in the server &ndash; it is merely an access point to a secure token associated with an <code>api-key</code> the user has (a new <code>api-key</code> is created if the session creation request is valid but no current active session key is available.)</p>

<p>An interesting thing I noticed while re-reading the <a href="http://log.simplabs.com/post/57702291669/better-authentication-in-ember-js">SimpLabs blog post</a> I mentioned previously is that this scheme does not allow a user to delete their <em>access token</em> from the server at all. Logging out just means clearing the token cookie &ndash; if the user re-authenticates the server will just dish them out the same token. If I extended the logout action to clear the token from the server however, all of the user&rsquo;s sessions would become invalidated, so I&rsquo;d have to change the scheme to create new access tokens for every separate login. I&rsquo;ll leave it as is for now and have a think about it.</p>

<p>As with all other ember things, the instructions were written with a prior version of ember and so don&rsquo;t work anymore. I had a bit of fun getting it working but a couple of things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>use latest version of bcrypt</li>
<li>use &lsquo;jquery-cookie-rails&rsquo; gem</li>
<li>demo uses the <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api">Rails::API</a> gem instead of creating a whole Rails application with views etc. Because I previously used the <em>ember-rails</em> gem I didn&rsquo;t do this</li>
<li>retrieving data from the store is done differently now &ndash; see the ember docs</li>
<li>accessing the store from anything other than a router can be difficult. I get it with this hackery: <code>var store = GameTableServer.__container__.lookup('store:main')</code> (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19401087/ember-js-how-to-get-access-to-store-from-app-object">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19401087/ember-js-how-to-get-access-to-store-from-app-object</a>)

<ul>
<li>TRICK! another problem &ndash; store returns an async promise, so you need to wait for that! god dammit. <code>var self = this; store.get(...).then(function(user) { self.set('apiKey', ...)})</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if something doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working, keep an eye on your browser&rsquo;s javascript console, net traffic and your rails logs (in heroku you can do this with <code>heroku logs</code> or something)</li>
</ul>


<p>You can have a look at the app as it currently stands (as of Jan 2014) on <a href="http://seshbot.herokuapp.com">seshbot.herokuapp.com</a>. If you&rsquo;re reading this much after Jan 2014 however it probably wont be there any longer.</p>

<h3>Alternative: Use &lsquo;devise&rsquo; gem directly</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> seems like a very mature and comprehensive rails &lsquo;authentication solution&rsquo; that seems to handle a lot of authentication related problems out of the box in a very configurable way. It takes care of a lot of stuff like sending password reset emails, locking accounts after failed validations, connecting to various auth providers, and lots of other stuff. I will probably end up moving towards it if I ever make an app that warrants that kind of thoroughness.</p>

<p>I found a pretty useful comment on stack overflow that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16513066/devise-with-rails-4">details how to get it running quickly with Rails 4</a> &ndash; not sure if thats more useful than the docs.</p>

<p>I started following <a href="https://github.com/heartsentwined/ember-auth-rails-demo/wiki">this very detailed tutorial</a> on using rails + ember + devise and found it very useful. Again, I couldn&rsquo;t get things working well together and had to abandon it. If I were to revisit I might also consider following these <a href="http://avitevet.blogspot.com.es/2012/11/ember-rails-devise-token-authentication.html">very detailed instructions on devise + ember</a>.</p>

<h3>Alternative: Use SimpleAuth for client-side stuff</h3>

<p>SimpLabs' <a href="https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth">SimpleAuth</a> (discussed in <a href="http://log.simplabs.com/post/63565686488/ember-simpleauth">this SimpLabs blog</a> and mentioned previously in this post) looks pretty cool, and is recently very active. It is still v0.1.0 so I&rsquo;d prefer to keep away from it for now, but if I wanted OAuth integration (to have a &lsquo;login with Facebook&rsquo; or whatever) I might look into using this for the client-side code.</p>

<h2>My current conclusion</h2>

<p>It is laughable that Ember and Rails are in such states of flux that it was easier to hand-roll a solution (although based on a very detailed set of instructions!) than it was to use existing gems and plugins. I hope that changes in the future.</p>

<p>If I ever decide I want a more complex auth solution using rails and ember, I&rsquo;d probably look at using devise for the Rails side and SimpleAuth for the ember side. I would expect a lot of heart-ache along the way though.</p>

    <id>http://seshbot.com/blog/2014/01/15/creating-a-rails-plus-ember-app-from-scratch</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I decided to wield my new Rails and Ember knowledge and&hellip; look into yet another new technology. I thought it would be helpful to have an online app to demonstrate the fruits of my labours, so am deploying a new app to <strong><a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Heroku is an &lsquo;application platform&rsquo; in the cloud, meaning that you can push certain kinds of apps (written in Ruby, Python, Java and Node.js) and it will ensure all the correct infrastructure is in place. When you sign up you get to host one app for free so it&rsquo;s easy to try out.</p>

<p>Later I will probably move to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>, which provides a basic virtual machine in the cloud that you can do anything with. This will allow me to host multiple applications without having to worry about paying money. Heroku <em>does</em> offer some pretty nice scaling, monitoring and deployment tools though (the admin panel literally has a slider to allow you to spin up new application instances.)</p>

<p>This post shows how I went through all steps, including setting up the PostgreSQL database on OSX, creating a skeleton Rails app, and deploying to Heroku. It is a culmination of having gone through several sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>much was taken from this useful step-by-step &lsquo;<a href="http://www.devmynd.com/blog/2013-3-rails-ember-js">Rails + Ember blog post</a>&rsquo; and this <a href="http://www.devmynd.com/blog/2013-10-live-on-the-edge-with-rails-ember-js">follow up post</a> that incorporates changes for newer versions of the frameworks.</li>
<li>when I got to the part involving installing the &lsquo;ember-rails&rsquo; gem, I found that the <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails">ember-rails documentation</a> was pretty useful.</li>
<li>some of the Heroku stuff came from the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/code_tv/heroku">Heroku Code School lesson</a> summary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing a database</h2>

<p>By default Rails will use sqlite3 for its database, and this isn&rsquo;t by default available in Heroku. As I&rsquo;m going to have to do some configuration anyway, I might as well choose a nicer database.</p>

<p>I was deciding between MongoDb and PostgreSQL. MongoDb offers flexibility when it comes to managing file assets in your database, while PostgreSQL is much more well established in existing hosting infrastructures (AWS and Heroku), so can make initial deployment much simpler. Mongo is also more amenable to schema changes because it&rsquo;s a NoSQL schema-less document database, but I think Rails is supposed to make schema changes easy anyway with the various <code>db:</code> commands.</p>

<p>As Heroku comes with PostgreSQL support out of the box, for now I&rsquo;ll go with Postgres. I&rsquo;m as yet not very familiar with Heroku and want to make things easier on myself.</p>

<p>The following installation instructions came from a blog entry on <a href="http://ricochen.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/install-postgres-on-mac-os-x-lion-with-homebrew-howto/">installing PostgreSQL on OSX with HomeBrew</a>:
```bash Installing PostgreSQL on  OSX</p>

<h1>easiest if you have homebrew installed</h1>

<p>brew install postgresql</p>

<h1>ensure it starts up when your machine starts</h1>

<p>ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist</p>

<h1>ensure you don&rsquo;t accidentally run the older version</h1>

<p>echo &lsquo;export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH&rsquo; >> ~/.bash_profile &amp;&amp; . ~/.bash_profile</p>

<h1>create a database user for the application to use</h1>

<h1>(alternatively you should be able to run &lsquo;createuser -d myapp&rsquo;)</h1>

<p>psql postgres <code>whoami</code>
create role myapp with CREATEDB login password &lsquo;password1&rsquo;;
```</p>

<p><em>Notes:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>the <code>createuser</code> command can replace the <code>psql</code> command stuff: <code>createuser -d myapp</code></em></li>
<li><em>if the DB username is different to the application name (below) you&rsquo;ll need to change the rails configuration later so it knows which username to use</em></li>
<li><em>I assume Heroku doesn&rsquo;t require you to manage the database at all</em></li>
</ul>


<h2>Creating a simple Rails app</h2>

<p>Creating a Rails app is really simple <em>once you know the commands</em>. So from scratch, if you include all the learning involved behind each command, it&rsquo;s actually not very simple. But these steps make it simple for me.</p>

<p>TIPS: I read somewhere that you should always run <code>bundle exec</code> before running a rails command to ensure that you&rsquo;re only working with gems in your Gemfile. Technically you could run all the commands below without prepending <code>bundle exec</code> however.</p>

<p><code>bash Creating the rails application framework
rails new myapp --database=postgresql
cd myapp
vim config/database.yml # set the database username and password, and on OSX un-comment the 'local' setting
bundle exec rake db:create    # create databases
bundle exec rails generate scaffold Thing name:string # generate model/views/controllers
bundle exec rake db:migrate   # update database with model data
bundle exec rails s           # start rails server localhost:3000
</code></p>

<p><em>Note: I had to uncomment the &lsquo;local&rsquo; setting from my </em>database.yml<em> file because rails couldn&rsquo;t connect due to permission problems on the local socket file. I could have reconfigured postgres instead but meh.</em></p>

<p>OSX users can also use <a href="http://pow.cx/">POW!</a> or <a href="http://anvilformac.com/">Anvil</a> (which uses POW! under the covers) to set up a fake URL pointing to their local rails app directories, so in my case I can visit <a href="http://myapp.dev">http://myapp.dev</a> and it will actually show me the app running on my local machine. It makes the testing cycle a lot quicker.</p>

<p>Add some simple static content:
```bash Generate some simple content in the Rails app
rails generate controller StaticPages home about &mdash;no-test-framework</p>

<h1>set root &lsquo;/&rsquo; route to point to static home page</h1>

<p>vim config/routes.rb # add &ldquo;root &lsquo;static_pages#home&rsquo;&rdquo; beneath other routes
```</p>

<p>Now you should be able to visit <code>localhost:3000</code> and see a generic &lsquo;home&rsquo; page message.</p>

<!-- x_ -->


<h3>Check in to git</h3>

<p>This creates a local git repository, but during the heroku deployment step I&rsquo;ll push it over there too. I&rsquo;ll also push it to GitHub when it looks like more of an app. So in git parlance, this is what I&rsquo;ll have on my local machine:</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/plantuml/7ff3365c0f4bc5f7e2db66419707938a.png'></center></p>

<p><code>bash Create the local 'master' git repository
rake tmp:clear
git init .
git add -f *
git commit -a -m"Initial commit"
</code></p>

<p>I regularly run those <code>git</code> commands to make it easier to revert any mistakes I happen to make.</p>

<h3>Adding ember framework</h3>

<p>I have tried two alternative approaches to creating a new rails app for ember.</p>

<h4>Alternative 1: use the ember &lsquo;edge template&rsquo;</h4>

<p>I think this one is probably the best as it was demonstrated by Yehuda Katz (main Ember guy) in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpQj9_qEUAc">this live demonstration video</a>. I ran a diff on projects created with and without and it seems to:</p>

<ul>
<li>adds some ember gems to the Gemfile: <code>active_model_serializers</code>, <code>ember-rails</code> and <code>ember-source</code></li>
<li>remove the rails &lsquo;application view layout&rsquo; (<em>app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</em>)</li>
<li>create an ember &lsquo;application template&rsquo; (<em>app/assets/javascripts/templates/application.handlebars</em>)</li>
<li>creates a &lsquo;view asset&rsquo; that generates an index.html with the ember application.js in it (<em>app/views/assets/index.html.erb</em>)</li>
<li>sets up a rails route pointing to the assets controller &lsquo;index&rsquo; action (<em>config/routes.rb</em>)</li>
<li>create empty assets controller and helper files (not sure why)</li>
<li>create a rails ActiveModel &lsquo;application serializer&rsquo; (<em>app/serializers/application_serializer.rb</em>) that does a few things ember requires <!-- x_ --></li>
</ul>


<p>Installing using the edge template is simple. Just replace the <code>rails new</code> step above with the following:</p>

<p>```bash Creating a rails app using the ember template
rails new myapp &mdash;database=postgresql -m <a href="http://emberjs.com/edge_template.rb">http://emberjs.com/edge_template.rb</a>
cd myapp</p>

<h1>edit your database config and Gemfile as before&hellip;</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p><em>Note: I had problems using the remote edge template, so downloaded it and used my local copy instad.</em></p>

<h4>Alternative 2: add ember to an existing rails app</h4>

<p>You could also just add the <code>ember-rails</code> gem directly to your Gemfile, then run <code>rails generate ember:bootstrap</code> and you get a basic Ember framework in your <code>app/assets</code> directory. I also prefer to use javascript directly (as opposed to CoffeeScript, which is the default), so add <code>-g --javascript-engine js</code></p>

<p>```bash Add a simple Ember application framework to the Rails app
vim Gemfile</p>

<h1>add &lsquo;gem &ldquo;ember-rails&rdquo;, github: &ldquo;emberjs/ember-rails&rdquo;&rsquo;</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Following this approach I believe you&rsquo;ll have to manually set up the <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers">Ember ActiveModel Serializer</a> which was written by the Ember guys, and ensures your Ember app understands the format of your Rails app&rsquo;s JSON data. The first alternative does this for you.</p>

<h4>Common to both approaches</h4>

<p>After you have created and updated your Gemfile, you still need to bootstrap the ember environment, and then ensure Ember is running in &lsquo;development&rsquo; mode when Rails is.</p>

<p><em>Note: you can Set &lsquo;developer mode&rsquo; (which enables developer-centric error messages and is apparently quite useful) by updating your </em>config/environments/development.rb<em> with: <code>config.ember.variant = :development</code>. By default running locally will run in dev mode, and running on Heroku will run production mode however.</em></p>

<p>```bash Add a simple Ember application framework to the Rails app
bundle install
bundle exec rails g ember:bootstrap -g &mdash;javascript-engine js
bundle exec rails g ember:install &mdash;head</p>

<p>vim config/environments/development.rb # add config.ember.variant = :development
```</p>

<h2>Deploying to Heroku</h2>

<p>Heroku requires a few rails settings to be modified to work properly:</p>

<p>```bash Change rails app settings for Heroku
vim config/environments/production.rb # heroku runs in prod mode by default</p>

<h1>change &lsquo;config.serve_static_assets&rsquo; to true</h1>

<p>vim Gemfile</p>

<h1>add &ldquo;gem &lsquo;rails_12factor&rsquo;&rdquo;</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>I have already gone through the Heroku sign up process and installed the toolbelt appropriate for OSX (the toolbelt provides the <code>heroku</code> command line tool), so I won&rsquo;t outline that here.</p>

<p>Installing my rails application on Heroku was then a simple matter of:</p>

<p>```bash Add application in the current directory to Heroku
heroku login
heroku create &mdash;stack cedar
git push heroku master</p>

<h1>whenever you make database changes</h1>

<p>heroku run rake db:migrate</p>

<h1>if you want to push your local database contents to heroku</h1>

<p>heroku db:push # requires the &lsquo;taps&rsquo; gem (&lsquo;gem install taps&rsquo;)
```</p>

<p>This creates an image with a particular configuration of applications and adds a <code>heroku</code> git remote to the git configuration.</p>

<p>Now you can visit the heroku app online (in my case at <a href="http://seshbot.herokuapp.com/">http://seshbot.herokuapp.com/</a>).</p>

<p>TODO: use <code>gem rails_12factor</code>? This alters the rails app a little to make it <a href="http://12factor.net/">12 factor</a>, which is a set of guidelines for how one should build an application to make it easier to administer and deploy. Not really important right now though.</p>

<!-- x_ -->


<h2>Troubleshooting and administering Heroku</h2>

<p><code>bash Various heroku debugging commands
heroku ps    # list running apps
heroku logs  # show application logs
heroku run console # run interactive ruby console
</code></p>

<p><code>bash Various heroku administrative commands
heroku config  # configure remote app through environment variables
heroku apps    # overview of apps
heroku destroy # deallocate remote server
heroku run rake db:migrate
</code></p>

<p><code>heroku config</code> sets environment variables for things you don&rsquo;t want to commit to git (e.g., passwords). Configure your Rails apps to use <code>ENV['MY_VAR']</code> instead of your super secret key, then run <code>heroku config:add MY_VAR=blahblah</code>.</p>

<p>There are also various <code>heroku pg:</code> commands for updating the application database. The application itself doesn&rsquo;t have full admin access to the database so you can&rsquo;t for example write <code>heroku run rake db:drop</code>. Instead you should run <code>heroku pg:reset</code> if you want to clear the database.</p>

    <id>http://seshbot.com/blog/2014/01/11/this-week-in-review-the-game-table-web-app</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First here&rsquo;s a quick summary of what I got up to:</p>

<ol>
<li>trying to build a simple &lsquo;gaming table&rsquo; application in Ember.js,</li>
<li>styling with Twitter bootstrap,</li>
<li>messing with plugins in my blog (trying unsuccessfully to fix code highlighting, and adding a UML tool &ndash; see below)</li>
</ol>


<p><center><img src='/images/plantuml/00178544eeee1acd089c0ec4883b3611.png'></center></p>

<p>I spent most of my time learning about Ember. <a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember.js</a> is a very nice looking front-end MVC framework that has a very appealing <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/">getting started guide</a> that make it look <em>super simple</em> to create a reactive application. Three things that people will not tell you however:</p>

<ul>
<li>demo videos only ever show the main usage scenario of that framework</li>
<li>most new frameworks change so often that they&rsquo;re either unstable or very little up-to-date documentation exists, and</li>
<li>many of the benefits they offer you probably won&rsquo;t end up using anyway, for various reasons</li>
</ul>


<p>For now though I&rsquo;ll go ahead with it because I feel that I&rsquo;m just about to start doing cool stuff in it (it kinda always feels like this though.)</p>

<p><strong>Next week</strong> I&rsquo;m thinking of switching back to some C++ stuff so I can dabble in a realm I&rsquo;m more comfortable with for a while&hellip; Monday is a public holiday in Japan though so I&rsquo;ll probably be wandering around and not programming much.</p>

<h3>Problem 1: binding non-nested components was difficult</h3>

<p>I figured I would devote my first day last week to creating the framework for a small Gaming Table application. Perhaps just start off with a quick chat client or sketching app. I was not accounting however for the vagaries of modern web application development, and I ended up messing around with stupid little problems for most of the week. Looking back I feel it was quite frustrating overall &ndash; it seems that many of these new techs do not quite work as advertised, if at all.</p>

<p>Most tutorials and documentation will usually only tell you about one way to make an ember app &ndash; showing the details of a single entity or collection of entities of the same type at a time. Perhaps it might be some blogging application that lets you dig down into various blog entries, or perhaps it will involve showing all the tweets from a particular tweeter. Whatever the demo, I&rsquo;m sure it will show you how to explore <em>a single concept</em>.</p>

<p>The first thing I wanted to do was to show your online friends on the left side and allow you to create or enter an existing chat room. I immediately got stuck on a stupid little problem however that I stubbornly refused to get past, leading to several wasted days.</p>

<p>My specific problem was <em>how can I make the nav bar show the name of the current gaming table (kind of like a chat room), but show some placeholder message if I&rsquo;m not in a room</em>. The problem being that the region dedicated to showing information about the current table (players, cards etc) is not a descendent hierarchically of the nav bar.</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/plantuml/09385b523a9258b9f2b64d6596a93d8e.png'></center></p>

<p>Long story short, the correct way seems to involve: 1) modifying the &lsquo;Nav Bar&rsquo; controller to add a dependency to the &lsquo;Game Table&rsquo; controller; 2) add to the Nav Bar controller an alias or dynamic property pointing to the Game Table controller (this is conceptually the last table loaded); and 3) creating another dynamic property in the Nav Bar controller that is updated whenever <code>currentPath</code> is updated, and returns <code>null</code> if the route (<code>currentRouteName</code>) is no longer a table.</p>

<p>This might make sense, but it was a pain in the ass to discover. (Side note: I&rsquo;m working on a general &lsquo;getting to know Ember.js&rsquo; post that goes into a lot more detail on this so others tackling the same problem might not have to spend as long as I spent on it.)</p>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m concerned that the Ember docs might not cover enough real world scenarios that &lsquo;proper&rsquo; applications might encounter (e.g., several regions dedicated to different information.)</p>

<h3>Live Help in IRC! 1980&rsquo;s tech to the rescue</h3>

<p>The IRC channel is pretty awesome &ndash; the #emberjs channel of freenode.org is one of the most populated channels on the server, and I&rsquo;ve saved a lot of time by asking for help there.</p>

<p>I spent a long time digging through documentation on how to solve this problem before I turned to IRC. Then within 10 minutes I had someone giving me meaningful advice that I ended up using. The secret was that I went in there with a minimalistic example of my problem that they could mark up and fix for me. <a href="http://jsbin.com/UzaFUZE/1/edit?html,js,output">Here&rsquo;s</a> the code I gave them and <a href="http://jsbin.com/UzaFUZE/4/edit?html,js,output">here&rsquo;s</a> what they gave me.</p>

<h3>Hosting a backend</h3>

<p>I have been mainly concentrating on the front end functionality so far, so didn&rsquo;t want to spend too long messing around with the server side. I had originally decided that I&rsquo;d learn some rails, but decided to try out a &lsquo;no backend&rsquo; solution &ndash; in this case <a href="http://deployd.com">deployd</a>. The two criteria I was after were a simple REST API and some kind of authentication, both of which deployd ostensibly offers. There were a few hiccups though.</p>

<p>The first was that deployd is still actively being developed, so the web UI isn&rsquo;t totally intuative. I won&rsquo;t go too far into it but it has been a hassle.</p>

<p>The next problem is that although both Ember and Deployd declare that they speak standard REST JSON language, it turns out they don&rsquo;t agree on how that language should look. I had to mess around a fair amount and ask around on IRC before discovering that you need to apply your own serializer, that intercepts all remote data transfers and allows you to &lsquo;munge&rsquo; it a little into a format that Ember is happy with.</p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;ll include the details of all this in a post dedicated to Ember later.</p>
