    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I decided to wield my new Rails and Ember knowledge and&hellip; look into yet another new technology. I thought it would be helpful to have an online app to demonstrate the fruits of my labours, so am deploying a new app to <strong><a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Heroku is an &lsquo;application platform&rsquo; in the cloud, meaning that you can push certain kinds of apps (written in Ruby, Python, Java and Node.js) and it will ensure all the correct infrastructure is in place. When you sign up you get to host one app for free so it&rsquo;s easy to try out.</p>

<p>Later I will probably move to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>, which really just provide you with a basic virtual machine in the cloud that you can do anything with, so that I can host multiple apps without paying money.</p>

<p>This post shows how I went through all steps, including setting up the PostgreSQL database on OSX, creating a skeleton Rails app, and deploying to Heroku. It is a culmination of having gone through several sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>much was taken from this useful step-by-step &lsquo;<a href="http://www.devmynd.com/blog/2013-3-rails-ember-js">Rails + Ember blog post</a>&rsquo; and this <a href="http://www.devmynd.com/blog/2013-10-live-on-the-edge-with-rails-ember-js">follow up post</a> that incorporates changes for newer versions of the frameworks.</li>
<li>when I got to the part involving installing the &lsquo;ember-rails&rsquo; gem, I found that the <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails">ember-rails documentation</a> was pretty useful.</li>
<li>some of the Heroku stuff came from the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/code_tv/heroku">Heroku Code School lesson</a> summary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing a database</h2>

<p>I was deciding between MongoDb and PostgreSQL. According to <a href="http://hammad.ca/experiments/2013/08/25/mongodb-vs-sql/">this article</a>, MongoDb offers flexibility when it comes to managing file assets in your database, while PostgreSQL is much more well established in existing hosting infrastructures (AWS and Heroku), so can make initial deployment much simpler. Mongo is also more amenable to schema changes because it&rsquo;s a NoSQL schema-less document database, but I think Rails is supposed to make schema changes easy anyway with the various <code>db:</code> commands.</p>

<p>For now I&rsquo;ll go with Postgres because I&rsquo;m as yet not very familiar with Heroku and want to make things easier on myself.</p>

<p>The following installation instructions came from a blog entry on <a href="http://ricochen.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/install-postgres-on-mac-os-x-lion-with-homebrew-howto/">installing PostgreSQL on OSX with HomeBrew</a>:
```bash Installing PostgreSQL on  OSX</p>

<h1>easiest if you have homebrew installed</h1>

<p>brew install postgresql</p>

<h1>ensure it starts up when your machine starts</h1>

<p>ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist</p>

<h1>ensure you don&rsquo;t accidentally run the older version</h1>

<p>echo &lsquo;export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH&rsquo; >> ~/.bash_profile &amp;&amp; . ~/.bash_profile</p>

<h1>create a database user for the application to use</h1>

<h1>(alternatively you should be able to run &lsquo;createuser -d myapp&rsquo;)</h1>

<p>psql postgres <code>whoami</code>
create role myapp with CREATEDB login password &lsquo;password1&rsquo;;
```</p>

<p><em>Notes:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><em>the <code>createuser</code> command can replace the <code>psql</code> command stuff: <code>createuser -d myapp</code></em></li>
<li><em>if the DB username is different to the application name (below) you&rsquo;ll need to change the rails configuration later so it knows which username to use</em></li>
<li><em>I assume Heroku doesn&rsquo;t require you to manage the database at all</em></li>
</ul>


<h2>Creating a simple Rails app</h2>

<p>Creating a Rails app is really simple <em>once you know the commands</em>. So from scratch, if you include all the learning involved behind each command, it&rsquo;s actually not very simple. But these steps make it simple for me.</p>

<p>TIPS: I read somewhere that you should always run <code>bundle exec</code> before running a rails command to ensure that you&rsquo;re only working with gems in your Gemfile. Technically you could run all the commands below without prepending <code>bundle exec</code> however.</p>

<p><code>bash Creating the rails application framework
rails new myapp --database=postgresql
cd myapp
vim config/database.yml # set the database username and password, and on OSX un-comment the 'local' setting
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rails generate scaffold Thing name:string
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rails s
</code></p>

<p><em>Note: I had to uncomment the &lsquo;local&rsquo; setting from my </em>database.yml<em> file because rails couldn&rsquo;t connect due to permission problems on the local socket file. I could have reconfigured postgres instead but meh.</em></p>

<p>OSX users can also use <a href="http://pow.cx/">POW!</a> or <a href="http://anvilformac.com/">Anvil</a> (which uses POW! under the covers) to set up a fake URL pointing to their local rails app directories, so in my case I can visit <a href="http://myapp.dev">http://myapp.dev</a> and it will actually show me the app running on my local machine. It makes the testing cycle a lot quicker.</p>

<p>Add some simple static content:
<code>bash Generate some simple content in the Rails app
rails generate controller StaticPages home about --no-test-framework
</code></p>

<p>Now you should be able to visit <code>localhost:3000/static_pages/home</code> and see a generic message.</p>

<h3>Check in to git</h3>

<p>This creates a local git repository, but during the heroku deployment step I&rsquo;ll push it over there too. I&rsquo;ll also push it to GitHub when it looks like more of an app. So in git parlance, this is what I&rsquo;ll have on my local machine:</p>

<p><center><img src='/images/plantuml/7ff3365c0f4bc5f7e2db66419707938a.png'></center></p>

<p><code>bash Create the local 'master' git repository
rake tmp:clear
git init .
git add -f *
git commit -a -m"Initial commit"
</code></p>

<p>I regularly run those <code>git</code> commands to make it easier to revert any mistakes I happen to make.</p>

<h3>Adding ember framework</h3>

<p>Note that according to the <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails">ember-rails docs</a> one may create the project using <code>rails new my_app -m http://emberjs.com/edge_template.rb</code> for a good start. I did not do this however.</p>

<p>One way to get started with ember with rails is to use the <code>ember-rails</code> gem. Just add <code>gem "ember-rails"</code> to your Gemfile, then run <code>rails generate ember:bootstrap</code> and you get a bunch of files. I also prefer to use javascript directly (as opposed to CoffeeScript, which is the default), so add <code>-g --javascript-engine js</code></p>

<p>Set &lsquo;developer mode&rsquo; (which enables developer-centric error messages and is apparently quite useful) by updating your <em>config/environments/development.rb</em> with: <code>config.ember.variant = :development</code>.</p>

<p>```bash Add a simple Ember application framework to the Rails app
vim Gemfile # add &lsquo;gem &ldquo;ember-rails&rdquo;, github: &ldquo;emberjs/ember-rails&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>bundle install
bundle exec rails g ember:bootstrap -g &mdash;javascript-engine js
bundle exec rails g ember:install &mdash;head</p>

<p>vim config/environments/development.rb # add config.ember.variant = :development
```</p>

<h2>Rails &ndash;> Ember connection</h2>

<p>Use Ember ActiveModel Serializer: <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers">https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers</a></p>

<h2>Deploying to Heroku</h2>

<p>I have already gone through the Heroku sign up process and installed the toolbelt appropriate for OSX (the toolbelt provides the <code>heroku</code> command line tool.)</p>

<p>Installing my rails application on Heroku was then a simple matter of:</p>

<p>```bash Add application in the current directory to Heroku
heroku login
heroku create &mdash;stack cedar
git push heroku master</p>

<h1>whenever you make database changes</h1>

<p>heroku run rake db:migrate
```</p>

<p>This creates an image with a particular configuration of applications and adds a <code>heroku</code> git remote to the git configuration.</p>

<p>Now you can visit the heroku app online (in my case at <a href="http://seshbot.herokuapp.com/static_pages/home">http://seshbot.herokuapp.com/static_pages/home</a>).</p>

<p>TODO: use <code>gem rails_12factor</code>? This alters the rails app a little to make it <a href="http://12factor.net/">12 factor</a>, which is a set of guidelines for how one should build an application to make it easier to administer and deploy. Not really important right now though.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting and administering Heroku</h2>

<p><code>bash Various heroku debugging commands
heroku ps    # list running apps
heroku logs  # show application logs
heroku run console # run interactive ruby console
</code></p>

<p><code>bash Various heroku administrative commands
heroku config  # configure remote app through environment variables
heroku apps    # overview of apps
heroku destroy # deallocate remote server
heroku run rake db:migrate
</code></p>

<p><code>heroku config</code> sets environment variables for things you don&rsquo;t want to commit to git (e.g., passwords). Configure your Rails apps to use <code>ENV['MY_VAR']</code> instead of your super secret key, then run <code>heroku config:add MY_VAR=blahblah</code>.</p>
