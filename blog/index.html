			C++11/14 Idioms I Use Every Day</a>

		<p><em>if you want to see a bunch of people complaining about my rules regarding </em>auto<em>, have a look at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8193157">HackerNews</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/2dvirt/new_c_idioms_i_use_every_day/">Reddit</a></em></p>

<p>Most attention on the new C++ has focused on the changes that provide functionality and performance that was previously not possible, both library enhancements (chrono, regex, smart pointers, and stuff to help with lambdas for example) and core language enhancements (perfect forwarding, variadic templates, the new memory model and threading capabilities, initialiser lists and the like). This functionality will impact us all in helping to write more correct code and efficient libraries, but often will only be relevant in certain parts of our code.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='the first thing that struck me when I started using C++11 was the smaller features that I could take advantage of every time I put my fingers to the keyboard.'>
But the first thing that struck me when I started using C++11 was the smaller features that I could take advantage of every time I put my fingers to the keyboard. These are the things that make code more concise and simple and allow me to present my intentions more clearly.
</span></p>

<p>Stuff I take advantage of every day:</p>

<ul>
<li>more concise general coding:

<ul>
<li>lambdas for scoped initialisation or inline &lsquo;builder&rsquo; functions</li>
<li>new standard library functionality for string manipulation, particularly std::to_string() and std::stoi() etc</li>
<li>range-based for loop</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>clearer declarations:

<ul>
<li>inline member initialisation,</li>
<li>the <code>override</code>, <code>default</code> and <code>delete</code> keywords</li>
<li>delegating constructors,</li>
<li>uniform initialisation, especially when invoking or returning from functions</li>
<li>auto type deduction everywhere!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>far fewer dependencies on boost</li>
</ul>


<p>These are the things I think all C++ programmers should learn first, because they benefit you <em>straight away</em> and confer very little risk of being learned wrong.</p>

<p>At the very end I also mention a few upcoming features that I&rsquo;m really excited about as they will be game-changers.</p>

			C++ Trick: Use Make Without Makefiles</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I use CMake personally because managing Makefiles is a hassle. However, I still use <code>make</code> regularly for one purpose: to easily create quick apps without setting up any projects or infrastructure at all. I have no idea where I first heard about this trick, and I can find very little referring to it on the internet. I recently found out that most people didn&rsquo;t know about it though, so I thought I&rsquo;d put a bit of info up here so others can benefit from it.</p>

<p>Generally when using C++ in an IDE it can be a hassle to create a small test application for, say, verifying a new language feature works the way you think it does, or creating a test bed to create a self-contained but complicated algorithm. In such cases, when I am using an OS that supports <code>make</code>, I generally do this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>vim blah.cpp
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># write your small app</span>
</span><span class='line'>make blah
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># make magically runs &#39;c++ tmp.cpp -o tmp&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>./blah
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&hellip; and that&rsquo;s it. It turns out <code>make</code>, when no makefile is present, will try a bunch of stuff that includes searching for <code>.c</code> and <code>.cpp</code> candidate files for generating your target. If the target (in this case &lsquo;blah&rsquo;) ended instead in <code>.o</code> it would sensibly generate an object file without linking it into an executable!</p>

<p>There is no easy way to make it automatically detect dependencies and include them, so all your source has to be within that one file. But there are some further tricks you can do&hellip;</p>

<h2>Compilation options</h2>

<p>By default on my OSX at the moment, make will call my CLang compiler:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;int main() {}&quot;</span> &gt; tmp.cpp
</span><span class='line'>make tmp
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># c++ tmp.cpp -o tmp</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But without any special flags, CLang will compile without C++14 support, which I really want!</p>

<p>An easy workaround to this is to set your <code>CXXFLAGS</code> environment variable that contains the flags you always want to be passed to your C++ compiler by default. In my machine I have added to my <code>~/.bash_profile</code> file: <code>CXXFLAGS='-std=c++1y -stdlib=libc++'</code>. Now when I run this command I get:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>make tmp
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># c++ -std=c++1y -stdlib=libc++    tmp.cpp   -o tmp</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Thats pretty cool. Of course you can set any of make&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Implicit-Variables.html">implicit variables</a> to ensure your app is built with these flags by default. For example, the compiler can be changed to GCC by setting <code>CXX=gcc</code>.</p>

<p>You can also include default include paths and libraries to link against, so that your small apps are able to incorporate boost or even your own library that you are developing.</p>

			Swift: A Solid Modern Imperative Language</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>Note 1: these are first impressions only &ndash; I&rsquo;ve only spent a day really looking at the docs and playing with the XCode beta so I am probably mistaken about some stuff</em></p>

<p><em>Note 2: I am using a beta of XCode, and it has caused me some trouble (a mysterious service it starts keeps crashing, filling my HDD up with core files.) I would recommend waiting for the non-beta if I were you.</em></p>

<p>Apple recently announced the support of a new language targeted at the same application programming space as Objective C. It&rsquo;s called Swift and it seems to me a very good summary of the features all modern imperative languages are striving for.</p>

<p>The last decade or so has seen a strong resurgence in functional programing evangelism. Languages like F#, Scala, Clojure and even Erlang for a while re-introduced to mainstream programmers high-level concepts that imperative programmers were largely unfamiliar with. A short experiment with a language supporting algebraic data types, type inference, higher order functions, closures, or the standard foundational map, reduce and fold functions will convince any programmer that their language
would be far better off being more declarative.</p>

<p>For a comprehensive guide to the Swift language see the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html">Swift tour</a>.</p>

<p>I have wanted two write another iOS app for a while now, and so I&rsquo;m thinking Swift may be the way forward for me there. To that end I&rsquo;ve spent all this morning going through docs and messing with XCode to get a feel for the various idioms and coding styles it encourages&hellip;</p>

			Week in Review: Running in an Infinite World</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick snap of the 2D SFML client alongside a new OpenGL client:
<img src="/images/upload/2014-05-31-compare.png" title="&#34;SFML client alongside OpenGL client with QML overlays&#34;" alt="&#34;SFML client alongside OpenGL client with QML overlays&#34;"></p>

<p>OK I could have spent a bit longer on the screenshot &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t made any models yet other than cubes, and I&rsquo;m not using any textures, and I should have adjusted the angle and colour of the directional light to make it look like evening or morning or something, to show off some of the immediate benefits of going to 3D.</p>

<p>I did spend some time making the camera zoom in from a map-like view to a chase-cam view:
<img src="/images/upload/2014-05-31-zoomed.png" title="&#34;The camera is tethered to the player character&#34;" alt="&#34;The camera is tethered to the player character&#34;"></p>

<p>In general however I&rsquo;m hoping to ramp-down on the OpenGL stuff and go back to working on the core functionality. The last week was actually pretty productive:

<p>Also I&rsquo;ve been spending a fair amount of time in <a href="http://picopicocafe.com">PicoPico Cafe</a> when it&rsquo;s open, and I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll be spending more time there in the coming weeks as a bunch of construction is scheduled outside my house during business hours when nobody is supposed to be home.</p>

			Week in Review: Porting to Qt/QML With OpenGL</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>So I took a month holiday, and got out of the habit of writing blogs&hellip; hopefully this will break the dam, it&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t have a billion things to write about</em></p>

<p><em>Initial version only! I will add pics soon</em></p>

<p>Over the last many weeks I have been ploughing through a whole lot of new stuff I&rsquo;ve never used before. As mentioned in my last post I decided to up the graphics a bit, but specifically I wanted to figure out a system for a extensible UI for menus and other 2D overlays, and 3D or pseudo-3D graphics. Creating a decent UI controls library I have learned is very difficult (if kind of fun to be honest.) Making something that is flexible enough to automatically layout your controls in a sensible way where everything resizes based on the
content contained within is a very difficult problem that nobody should have to re-solve in this day and age. So I wanted to re-use one that I also wanted to learn for myself.</p>

<p>In order to add these to my existing framework I took on the (it turns out) monumental task of learning OpenGL and integrating it with Qt/QtQuick/QML.</p>

<p>So far things are looking OK, but I have found the learning curve greater than I&rsquo;d originally anticipated &ndash; OpenGL in particular is a rabbit warren of deprecation and messy global state idioms. That said, I currently have:</p>

<ul>
<li>the UI menu/control system is entirely QML based and very simple to extend and use</li>
<li>the game terrain is constructed using <a href="http://www.volumesoffun.com/polyvox-about/">PolyVox</a> because I wanted to avoid having to figure out mesh generation along with all this other stuff</li>
<li>the OpenGL shaders incorporate basic lighting and not much else</li>
</ul>


<p>The main value I&rsquo;ve gained is a fairly decent understanding of what it takes to create modern OpenGL applications (though how useful that knowledge is in this day and age I am not sure.) I have not tried porting any of this across to Windows yet (I&rsquo;ve written it all in OSX) but hopefully the fact that I&rsquo;m using entirely cross-platform technologies will help a little there &ndash; though Windows is known to have very dodgy OpenGL support so I suspect that will be the cause of most of my porting
troubles.</p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have once again bitten off a whole lot &ndash; I started making a game based on my fairly limited knowledge of how such things are done, and have found it very difficult to take a moment to distill my thoughts. In fact it has been nearly impossible as I have been constantly unsure of whether the approach I&rsquo;m taking is actually going to pay off in the long run!</p>

<p>This is just a catch-up on my experiences over the last few weeks, a few discoveries and surprises, and perhaps my plans for the immediate future. I decided at the last moment to include a screenshot here, but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve all seen brown circles on green backgrounds before&hellip;</p>

			Week in Review: Pausing Web App, Starting C++ App</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just over a week ago I decided to put down my web tools for a while and move to working in an environment in which I&rsquo;m much more comfortable &ndash; C++. I will definitely pick up the &lsquo;Table Top&rsquo; app (or whatever it turns into) again soon but I felt the need to do work that resulted in a more <em>tangible</em> product.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve had a growing realisation that the foundation of web programming is still immature, and I am doubting the value in investing too much time learning the high-level technologies. I am not really one for learning frameworks in general actually &ndash; I much prefer learning languages and idioms &ndash; and modern web programming is all about rapidly changing high-level frameworks.</p>

<p>That said however, I feel that I&rsquo;m finally at a point where I can start making useful stuff in Ember and Rails without feeling like I&rsquo;m misusing the tools or spending most of my time in Google. So last week I knocked off a few high-level features in my app to show the basic scaffolding I was considering (it only took a few hours in the end!), and then set it aside.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/upload/2014-02-03-seshbot-framework.png" title="&#34;Game Table App as of Feb 2014 - still doesn't do much&#34;" alt="&#34;Game Table App as of Feb 2014 - still doesn't do much&#34;"></p>

<p>There is a very duct-tape and chicken-wire feel to web technologies, but once you&rsquo;re familiar with the tech you can pump stuff out pretty quickly. Because of the immediate and ethereal nature of the web it can be a fantastic way of creating a product that is immediately globally available. All of the magic we see however is still largely magic however, and magic doesn&rsquo;t bode well in any application. The web as a platform for applications is still unbaked and young, and I feel that unless you&rsquo;re forging new territory on the frontier you&rsquo;re probably working with technologies that won&rsquo;t be interesting in a few years time.</p>

If you manage to surround yourself with great programmers you&rsquo;ll foster a much better environment in which you can become a great programmer yourself. If you find yourself surrounded by programmers you consider sub-par you&rsquo;ll end up supporting their crappy software.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='the best way to find great programmers is by giving them some control over the interview topic, and then going deep into a few questions instead of broad across many topics'>
I have been interviewing programmers for many years and reckon the best way to find great programmers is by giving them some control over the interview topic, and then going deep into a few questions instead of broad across many topics. This takes a lot of guts however &ndash; it requires the interviewer to pay attention, and ideally (though not necessarily) to have a fairly broad knowledge base themselves.
</span></p>

<p>I believe this advice applies to all programmers &ndash; of course interviewing is rarely in your job description, but it is definitely in your best interest to make sure interviews get done well at your company. Unfortunately most companies will allow anyone to interview and won&rsquo;t have a good way to tell that they&rsquo;re not doing it well, ultimately damaging the work environment.</p>

			Client-side Authentication With Ember and Rails</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This post follows on from the previous post <a href="/blog/2014/01/15/creating-a-rails-plus-ember-app-from-scratch/">creating and deploying a rails + ember app from scratch</a>. In that post I created a basic ember application being served from rails. Here I&rsquo;ll be adding user authentication to the application I created using the &lsquo;edge template&rsquo; option I discussed, which uses the &lsquo;ember-rails&rsquo; gem to establish the basic connectivity.</em></p>

<p>I do not want to implement authentication and authorization myself. It is tricky to get right and tends to cause huge damage when it goes wrong in production.</p>

<p>So I have spent at least three full days looking at various solutions I can build into my simple Ember/Rails application and spent a lot of time experimenting.</p>

<p>This post describes my current understanding of authentication for web applications, and the approach I used to implement a basic authentication system I put up on heroku at <a href="http://seshbot.herokuapp.com">http://seshbot.herokuapp.com</a></p>

<p>If you want to see the source code, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/seshbot/new-ember-rails-app">https://github.com/seshbot/new-ember-rails-app</a></p>

<p><em>NOTE: this is very text-heavy because after three full days I decided not to spend too long on this blog post. Therefore there are no images at this time. I may update it later to have some nice UML or screenshots, but that time is not now.</em></p>

			Creating and Deploying a Rails + Ember App</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today I decided to wield my new Rails and Ember knowledge and&hellip; look into yet another new technology. I thought it would be helpful to have an online app to demonstrate the fruits of my labours, so am deploying a new app to <strong><a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Heroku is an &lsquo;application platform&rsquo; in the cloud, meaning that you can push certain kinds of apps (written in Ruby, Python, Java and Node.js) and it will ensure all the correct infrastructure is in place. When you sign up you get to host one app for free so it&rsquo;s easy to try out.</p>

<p>Later I will probably move to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>, which provides a basic virtual machine in the cloud that you can do anything with. This will allow me to host multiple applications without having to worry about paying money. Heroku <em>does</em> offer some pretty nice scaling, monitoring and deployment tools though (the admin panel literally has a slider to allow you to spin up new application instances.)</p>

<p>This post shows how I went through all steps, including setting up the PostgreSQL database on OSX, creating a skeleton Rails app, and deploying to Heroku. It is a culmination of having gone through several sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>much was taken from this useful step-by-step &lsquo;<a href="http://www.devmynd.com/blog/2013-3-rails-ember-js">Rails + Ember blog post</a>&rsquo; and this <a href="http://www.devmynd.com/blog/2013-10-live-on-the-edge-with-rails-ember-js">follow up post</a> that incorporates changes for newer versions of the frameworks.</li>
<li>when I got to the part involving installing the &lsquo;ember-rails&rsquo; gem, I found that the <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember-rails">ember-rails documentation</a> was pretty useful.</li>
<li>some of the Heroku stuff came from the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/code_tv/heroku">Heroku Code School lesson</a> summary.</li>
</ul>
